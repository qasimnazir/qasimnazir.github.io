## Objective
The objective was to create a documnetation example that guides customers regarding employing a deep learning approach for predictive maintenance of industrial machinary.

## Methodology 
* Implemented a deep learning approach for RUL estimation and compared performance with parametric models.
* Created a [documentation example](https://www.mathworks.com/help/predmaint/ug/remaining-useful-life-estimation-using-convolutional-neural-network.html) using MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox and [Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#turbofan)

## Tools & Technologies
MATLAB DeepLearning Toolbox, Predicitve Maintenance, CNN, PyTorch
