## Objective
The gaol of final project for [CSE 6240 Big Data for Health](http://sunlab.org/teaching/cse6250/spring2021/) was to use Big Data Tools for solving a HealthCare problem. The problem definition was to develop a machine-learning based predicitve model for early detection of Sepsis which is a medical condition where the immune system damages the body as a result of fighting infection. 

## Methodology: 
*  Use SQL and PySpark to caluclate features from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III dataset
*  Replicate and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model using the calculated features
*  Experimental evaluation and parameter tuning
*  Present findings in a report
