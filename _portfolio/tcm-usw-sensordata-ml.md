This was my master's research work work at Univeristy of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 
Submited my [master's thesis](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/108054) and published a [journal paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1526612520308860?dgcid=coauthor) from this research work.

## Objective
The objective of MS thesis was to develop an online tool condition moitoring system for Ultrasonic Welding aiming to optimize tool life and reduce production downtime cost. 

## Methodology
* Installation of an automated data acquisition system using IoT sensors and NI DAQ device
* Development of a GUI for data acquisition 
* Design of experiments and data collection for research problem
* Data processing, feature engineering, and feature selection
* Machine Learning model development and hyper-parameter tuning

## Tools & Technologies
DAQ, MATLAB, Feature Engineering, Machine Learning
