**LSTM based early diagnosis of Sepsis-3** ([github repo](https://github.com/qasimnazir/LSTM-based-Sepsis-Prediciton))
   * The gaol of final project for [CSE 6240 Big Data for Health](http://sunlab.org/teaching/cse6250/spring2021/) was to use Big Data Tools for solving a HealthCare problem.
   * Problem Formulation: Develop a machine-learning based predicitve model for early detection of Sepsis which is a medical condition where the immune system damages the body as a result of fighting infection. 
   * Methodology: 
     *  Use SQL and PySpark to caluclate features from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III dataset
     *  Replicate and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model using the calculated features
     *  Experimental evaluation and parameter tuning
     *  Present findings in a report
   * *Tools & Technologies Used*: [MIMIC-III Clinical Database](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/), Google Big Query, SQL, PySpark, Feature Engineering, PyTorch, LSTM
