## Objective
The objective was to profile deep neural network implementations for instance segmentation architectures both in MATLAB (Mask RCNN) and PyTorch ([detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)).

## Methodology
* Developed scripts for training models in MATLAB & PyTorch with same architecture & training options and log time for various somputation steps such data loading, forward pass, backward pass, roi generation etc.
* Compared the profiling, identiied bottelnecks and presented findings to development team for performance improvement.

## Tools & Technologies
Computer Vision, Instance Segmentation, Mask R-CNN, detectron2, PyTorch, MATLAB, Linux, GPU
