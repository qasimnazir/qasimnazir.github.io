## Objective
The objective of course project was to go through all the steps in data science methodology such as problem definition, data collection, data pre-processing/cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, hyper-parameter tuning.

## Problem Definintion: 
Measuring soil properties such as Ca, P, pH, SOC using tradional laboratory based methods is expensive. We developed a regression model to predict these proprties using cheap spectroscopy data.
