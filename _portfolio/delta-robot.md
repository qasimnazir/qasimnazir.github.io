DELTA platform is a 3 DOF parallel robotic manipulator – a popular positioning architecture for additive manufacturing applications. 

## Methodology
* Architecture synthesis, Forward & Inverse Kinematics, Workspace determination
* Kinematic Error model & Optimization of Kinematic accuracy using MATLAB Optimization Toolbox
* Multibody Dynamics – performed rigid-body & flexible-body dynamic simulations using MSC ADAMS
* Control Systems Design – implemented a servo-motor position control model using Arduino-Mega
* Fabrication, Integration & Testing

This project was declared the best capstone project in the mechanical engineering department for the batch 2011-2015.
