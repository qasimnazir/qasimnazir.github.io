  * In this project, we focus on predicting sepsis, a medical condition where the immune system damages the body as a result of fighting infection. We introduce and replicate a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model that uses patient features from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III dataset for early identification and prediction of sepsis, as defined by Sepsis-3. Ultimately, this report highlights the approach and results for sepsis prediction. 
   * The gaol of final project for [CSE 6240 Big Data for Health](http://sunlab.org/teaching/cse6250/spring2021/) was to use Big Data Tools for solving a HealthCare problem. We used SQL and PySpark to caluclate features from the database and then trained a LSTM model for sepsis prediction.
