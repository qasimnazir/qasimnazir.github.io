I love to code and play with numbers. For the same reason, I am obsessed with scientific computing and artificial intelligence applications as they utilize a perfect blend of math, coding, and problem-solving skills. Over the past few years, I have gained hands-on experience and demonstrated aptitude in related fields such as data science, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, signal/image processing through various research and industrial projects.

Open to opportunities open where I can do value-addition using my skill set, grow my career and learn from & coach others at the same time.
